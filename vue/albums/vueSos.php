            I don't like nobody, I don't feel guilty about it
            I just got my body done, ain't got no guilt about it

        <h2>I hate you</h2>
        <p class="verses">[Verse 1]
            I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
            I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
            I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
            Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
            Arguments, you air me out
            Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
            I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
            I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
            And I can't shake this habit, no</p>
        <p class="verses">[Pre-Chorus]
            I've been up, baby
            Heavy reminiscin'
            Heavy on the missing you
            Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
            I've been up, baby
            Lost in the lie of us
            Lost, ain't no findin' us
            I've been up, baby</p>
        <p class="verses">[Chorus]
            And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
            Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
            What I would do to make you feel just like this
            And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
            Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
            What I would do to make you feel just like this</p>
        <p class="verses">[Verse 2]
            Used to bе too solid 'til you scrambled me
            Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
            Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
            Now I'm out here wildin' with you
            Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
            Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
            Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)</p>
        <p class="verses">[Pre-Chorus]
            I've been up, baby
            Heavy reminiscin'
            Heavy on the missing you
            Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
            I've been up, baby
            Lost in the lie of us
            Lost, ain't no findin' us
            I've been up, baby
