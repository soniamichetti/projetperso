        <h2>Sorry</h2>
        <p class="verses">[Verse 1]
            You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
            You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
            I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
            'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
            I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
            And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
            So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
            'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances</p>
        <p class="verses">[Chorus]
            Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
            'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
            Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
            Yeah, I know that I let you down
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>
        <p class="verses">[Drop]
            I'm sorry, yeah
            Sorry, yeah
            Sorry
            Yeah, I know that I let you down
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>
        <p class="verses">[Verse 2]
            I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
            But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
            I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
            Can we both say the words and forget this?</p>
        <p class="verses">[Chorus]
            Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
            'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
            Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
            Yeah, I know that I let you down
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
            I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
            'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
            Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
            Yeah, I know that I let you down
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>
        <p class="verses">[Drop]
            I'm sorry, yeah
            Sorry, oh
            Sorry
            Yeah, I know that I let you down (I know I let you down)
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
            I'm sorry, yeah
            Sorry, oh
            Sorry
            Yeah, I know that I let you down (I know I let you down)
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>

        <h2>Love yourself</h2>
        <p class="verses">[Verse 1]
            For all the times that you rained on my parade
            And all the clubs you get in using my name
            You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
            You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't</p>
        <p class="verses">[Refrain]
            And I didn't wanna write a song
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
            I don't, but you still hit my phone up
            And baby, I'll be movin' on
            And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
            Maybe you should know that</p>
        <p class="verses">[Pre-Chorus]
            My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            And I never like to admit that I was wrong
            And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
            But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
        <p class="verses">[Chorus]
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
            You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p class="verses">[Verse 2]
            But when you told me that you hated my friends
            The only problem was with you and not them
            And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
            And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>
        <p class="verses">[Refrain]
            And I didn't wanna write a song
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
            I don't, but you still hit my phone up
            And baby, I'll be movin' on
            And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
            Maybe you should know that

            You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p class="verses">[Bridge]
            For all the times that you made me feel small
            I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
            I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
            Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
        <p class="verses">[Chorus]
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
            You should go and love yourself
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
